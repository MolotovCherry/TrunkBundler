# Trunk bundler

This is a post-build hook to [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/) whose purpose is to minify the generated html and js output.

Features:
- Automatically minifies app js/html in release mode (sass/scss/css support will come eventually)
- You can also package your own project es modules (it also has node package support!) into one `dist.min.js` file

Note: Only tested on Windows so far, but should be able to support Linux. However, currently I think it will probably fail on Linux. Please submit a bug report as they come, it should be fairly quick to solve. ðŸ™‚

## To use:
### Add to `Trunk.toml`
```toml
[[hooks]]
stage = "post_build"
command = "/path/to/trunk_bundler.exe"
```

### Add to `index.html`
- (or equivalent) if you want to bundle and include a js project. This project can be a regular es module project, and can also optionally use node module packages and external libs you provide.
- You need to specify `data-bundler` to activate it.
- `href` is relative to the location of the `index.html` file it's defined in
- `data-output` is the resulting file you want the output to appear in. The path is relative to your `dist` folder
- `data-modules` specifies the root module of your js project. This can be a comma separated list as well such as `app, foo`
- You are allowed to have multiple ones of these, which would result in multiple js outputs.
```html
<link data-bundler rel="js" href="../static/scripts" data-modules="app" data-output="static/dist.min.js" />
```

### Final project setup
- `package.json`/`node_modules` is optional
- `lib` is optional. Place named folders inside this; all js files inside the folders will be included in the output js. The file names can be anything, and the folder structure inside does not matter.
- `src` is where your js files/modules live. If you specify `data-modules="app"`, it will look in `<href path>/src/<module name>.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` for the module.
- It will also look in `<href path>/<module name>.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` for the module if you would rather have a simpler setup.

â”‚   â”‚       file1.js
â”‚   â”‚       file2.js
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€lib2
â”‚           file1.js
â”‚           file2.js
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€node_modules
â”‚   â”‚ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€src
        app.js
```

## Final notes
This builder is also capable of building javascript, typescript, jsx, and tsx code.

Simply adding the binary post build will still minify your app html/js, you do not need any setup for that to happen other than adding the hook to your post build.

Also, all js modules/projects are built in parallel across multiple threads if you have multiple `<link>` tags
